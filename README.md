This repo contains the JS API and RingoJS application to drive the Monarch Initiative web interface.

You can run the website locally (see below).

The live version of the Monarch Initiative web interface is at [http://monarchinitiative.org](http://monarchinitiative.org).

## Quickstart

Just type

    ./install.sh

Then start the server:

    ./start-server.sh

You're done!

Connect on localhost:

 * http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Or a particular disease, e.g:

 * http://127.0.0.1:8080/disease/DOID_14692

## Alternate installation instructions

1. Install RingoJS - http://ringojs.org

2. Install stick

    ringo-admin install ringo/stick

3. Run app

    ringo lib/monarch/web/webapp_launcher.js --port 8080

## Widgets and sub-components

Monarch-app includes a home-grown widget framework for including
functionality components that are required for the operation of the
monarch-app, but not included in the monarch-app distribution. 

Currently, there is only one such widget - the [phenogrid
browser](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/phenogrid). 

Monarch-app will clone this repository into an appropriate location -
./widgets/phenogrid - upon installation. The phenogrid code will be
updated via a pull upon start of the process.  These steps will be
managed via the update_dependencies.sh script. 

Note that the .gitignore file explicitly ignores these components that
are pulled in separately.

Further components should be added in a similar manner.
